      <description>During the first phase of the pilot, Birdwatch is limited to a small test group in the US.
Our goal is to expand Birdwatch to the global Twitter community. We want anyone to be able to participate and know that having contributors with different points of view is essential to Birdwatch helpfully addressing misinformation. We’ll draw on learnings from this initial test and, over time, scale safely.

      <description>What are Birdwatch notes? Birdwatch is a pilot program that allows volunteer contributors on Twitter to collaboratively add context (called “notes”) to Tweets they believe could be misleading. The aim is to keep people on Twitter better informed by showing notes that people from different points of view will find helpful.
Notes are only shown to a small set of people in the pilot program, and notes only appear on Tweets when they’ve been rated helpful by enough people from different points of view.</description>

      <title>Birdwatch Aliases</title>

      <guid>https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/aliases/</guid>
      <description>We want everyone to feel comfortable contributing to Birdwatch. Aliases let contributors write and rate notes without sharing their Twitter usernames.
A Birdwatch alias is a new, auto-generated display name that contributors get when they join Birdwatch. Aliases are not publicly associated with contributors’ Twitter accounts, so everyone can write and rate notes privately.
Further, we believe aliases have the potential to:
 Reduce bias. By keeping focus on the content of notes rather than who’s writing them, aliases have the potential to reduce bias that people might have around specific authors.</description>

      <description>We know there are many challenges involved in building aan open, participatory system like Birdwatch — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn’t dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors.
Throughout our development process, we’ve conducted feedback sessions with Twitter customers and subject area experts to identify critical risks to monitor and mitigate. We will be closely focused on understanding and identifying solutions to prevent such risks during our initial pilot phase.</description>

      <description>Helpfulness scores are a way to give more influence to people with a track record of making high-quality contributions to Birdwatch. There are currently two types of author helpfulness scores and one rater helpfulness score.
In order to get enough data from new raters to be able to assess how similarly they rate notes to others, we require a minimum of 10 ratings made before helpfulness scores are computed and ratings may be counted.</description>

      <description>Birdwatch aims to identify notes that many people on Twitter will find helpful, including people with different points of view.
To find notes that are helpful to the broadest possible set of people, Birdwatch takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as helpful or unhelpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives.
Birdwatch assesses &amp;ldquo;different perspectives&amp;rdquo; entirely based on how people have rated notes in the past; Birdwatch does not ask about or use any other information to do this (e.</description>

      <description>Great Birdwatch notes follow the program&amp;rsquo;s values: They build understanding, are written in good faith, and are helpful even to those who disagree.
   &amp;ldquo;Whales aren&amp;rsquo;t real&amp;rdquo;   Here&amp;rsquo;s a Tweet making misleading claims about whales, followed by helpful and unhelpful Birdwatch notes:
Whales are not actually mammals. If Humans (land mammals) can’t drink seawater — just try it! — how can supposed sea mammals like whales stay hydrated?</description>

      <description>Birdwatch notes are submitted and rated by contributors. Ratings are used to determine note status labels (“Currently Rated Helpful”, “Currently Rated Not Helpful”, or “Needs More Ratings”). Note statuses also determine which notes are displayed on each of the Birdwatch Site’s timelines, and which notes are displayed as Birdwatch Cards on Tweets.
Only notes that indicate the Tweet as “potentially misleading” are eligible to be displayed as Birdwatch Cards on Tweets; notes that indicate the Tweet is “not misleading” are not displayed as Birdwatch Cards on Tweets.</description>

      <description>Birdwatch aims to create a better informed world, by empowering people on Twitter to collaboratively add helpful notes to Tweets that might be misleading. Contributors can identify Tweets they believe are misleading, write notes that provide context to the Tweet, and rate the quality of other contributors’ notes. Through consensus from a broad and diverse set of people, our eventual goal is that the most helpful notes will be visible directly on Tweets, available to everyone on Twitter.</description>
