      <description>What is Community Notes? Community Notes is a program that allows volunteer contributors on Twitter to collaboratively add context (called “notes”) to Tweets they believe could be misleading. The aim is to keep people on Twitter better informed by showing notes that people from different points of view will find helpful.
Notes only appear on Tweets when they’ve been rated helpful by enough people from different points of view.
This program is still in development.</description>

      <description>We know there are many challenges involved in building an open, participatory system like Community Notes — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts, to ensuring it isn’t dominated by a simple majority or biased because of the distribution of contributors.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been building Community Notes (formerly called Birdwatch) in public since January 2021, and have intentionally designed it to mitigate potential risks. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen encouraging results, but we&amp;rsquo;re constantly designing for challenges that could arise.</description>

      <title>Community Notes Aliases</title>

      <description>We want everyone to feel comfortable contributing to Community Notes. Aliases let contributors write and rate notes without sharing their Twitter usernames.
A Community Notes alias is a new, auto-generated display name that contributors get when they join Community Notes. Aliases are not publicly associated with contributors’ Twitter accounts, so everyone can write and rate notes privately.
Further, we believe aliases have the potential to:
 Reduce bias. By keeping focus on the content of notes rather than who’s writing them, aliases have the potential to reduce bias that people might have around specific authors.</description>

      <description>Helpfulness scores are a way to give more influence to people with a track record of making high-quality contributions to Community Notes. There are currently two types of author helpfulness scores and one rater helpfulness score.
In order to get enough data from new raters to be able to assess how similarly they rate notes to others, we require a minimum of 10 ratings made before helpfulness scores are computed and ratings may be counted.</description>

      <description>Community Notes aims to identify notes that many people on Twitter will find helpful, including people with different points of view.
To find notes that are helpful to the broadest possible set of people, Community Notes takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as helpful or unhelpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives.
Community Notes assesses &amp;ldquo;different perspectives&amp;rdquo; entirely based on how people have rated notes in the past; Community Notes does not ask about or use any other information to do this (e.</description>

      <description>Community Notes aims to create a better-informed world, by empowering people on Twitter to collaboratively add helpful context to Tweets that might be misleading or missing important context.
It’s important that the context that is elevated to viewers from Community Notes be helpful, informative, and accurate.
The note ranking algorithm is designed to help meet these quality standards, along with a number of additional safeguards built over the course of the program’s development.</description>

      <title>Locking and unlocking the ability to write notes</title>

      <description>To keep the quality of Community Notes high, contributors earn (and can lose) the ability to write notes.
Everyone who joins Community Notes can rate notes. They can unlock the ability to write notes by helping to identify helpful and unhelpful notes. If notes they write are found helpful, they’ll continue to have greater impact. If notes they write are consistently found not helpful, their ability to write notes will be temporarily locked, and they’ll have to earn it back.</description>

      <description>Community Notes are submitted and rated by contributors. Ratings are used to determine note statuses (“Helpful”, “Not Helpful”, or “Needs More Ratings”). Note statuses also determine which notes are displayed on each of the Community Notes Site’s timelines, and which notes are displayed on Tweets.
At this time, only notes that indicate a Tweet is “potentially misleading” are eligible to be displayed on Tweets. We observed that notes marking a Tweet as &amp;ldquo;not misleading&amp;rdquo; were often rated as “Unhelpful - Tweet doesn’t need a note”.</description>

Helpful attributes  Cites high-quality sources Easy to understand Directly addresses the Tweet’s claim Provides important context Neutral or unbiased language    Unhelpful attributes Helpful notes steer clear of all of these unhelpful attributes:
 Sources not included or unreliable Sources do not support note Incorrect information Opinion or speculation Typos or unclear language Misses key points or irrelevant Argumentative or biased language Note not needed on this Tweet Harassment or abuse     The following are examples of notes that illustrate what makes a note helpful (versus unhelpful):</description>

      <description>Community Notes&#39; goal is to show helpful context to people when they come across potentially misleading information on Twitter. When a note is rated Helpful by contributors, it starts being shown directly on the Tweet. Here&amp;rsquo;s how they show up:
  If a Tweet has a note that earned a status of Helpful after being rated by enough contributors then the note will be shown in a card on the Tweet, along with a button to rate the note.</description>

To ensure contributors don&amp;rsquo;t miss the opportunity to rate notes on Tweets getting a lot of attention, Community Notes sends alerts requesting help from time to time.
If you are a contributor, you should see these alerts in your notifications tab. Here&amp;rsquo;s what they look like:

Contributors can identify Tweets they believe are misleading, write notes that provide context to the Tweet, and rate the quality of other contributors’ notes. Through consensus from a broad and diverse set of people, our eventual goal is that the most helpful notes will be visible directly on Tweets, available to everyone on Twitter.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re having trouble with your phone number in Community Notes, here&amp;rsquo;s what you can do:
If your phone number is not verified You can verify your phone number by following Twitter&amp;rsquo;s Help Center instructions.

      <description>How does Birdwatch avoid one-sided bias? Pile-ons? Brigading? Manipulation? Abuse?
Community Notes are rated by contributors of multiple perspectives, and only notes that are widely found helpful are shown on Tweets. So one group alone can&amp;rsquo;t determine what notes get shown, and pile-ons aren&amp;rsquo;t effective.
This helps ensure that notes are helpful to a wide range of people.
To make it clear how all of this works, Birdwatch&amp;rsquo;s algorithm is open source, and all the data is public.</description>

      <description>Introducing Birdwatch.
Sometimes, Tweets can be misleading or miss important context.
[Cleve @All_the_sportz 1hr ago tweeted, “Police are reporting that 3 ostriches are loose in Central Station 😲”]
And you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure whether to trust the Tweet…
Birdwatch empowers people to share helpful context. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works:
Contributors propose notes that add context to Tweets. Notes are then rated by other contributors.
Decisions aren&amp;rsquo;t made by majority rules or popularity…So one group alone can&amp;rsquo;t determine what notes get shown.</description>
