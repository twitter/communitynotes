## Alerts when a note needs your help

Notes have the most impact when they get rated quickly and start showing on Tweets early. To ensure contributors don't miss the opportunity to rate notes on Tweets getting a lot of attention, Community Notes sends alerts requesting help from time to time.

If you are a contributor, you should see these alerts in your notifications tab. Here's what they look like:

### Configuring your alerts

The default setting for all contributors is "Often", which means you'll start by getting a few alerts per week. You can change that frequency by visiting your Community Notes profile and tapping the gear icon on the top right, or by clicking the button below:

### How does Community Notes decide which notes trigger alerts for help?

Alerts are optimized to increase the chance that potentially good notes on Tweets with predicted high visibility get rated by enough people to quickly earn the status of Helpful. Here's our current approach:

**Tweets are chosen based on:**

- Future projected likes and Retweets the Tweet will get.
- The rater can see the Tweet (for example, excludes Tweets from authors you've blocked)

**Notes are chosen based on:**

- Written by an author with high writing impact, or average helpfulness score of notes they authored.
- Currently have a status of "Needs More Ratings"
- High helpfulness score, nearing the threshold to earn status of "Helpful"
- Must not already have too many ratings

Contributors to review notes are chosen at random, excluding the note author, those who have already rated the note, and limited by their notification frequency setting.

We will continue to experiment with this logic to ensure contributors can have maximum impact with their notes and ratings.

## Other notifications

Contributors also receive notifications with status updates about the notes they've written and rated. At this time these are not configurable, but we plan to add more controls in the future.
