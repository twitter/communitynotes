1. ### "Whales aren't real"

Here's a Tweet making misleading claims about whales, followed by helpful and unhelpful Birdwatch notes:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whales are not actually mammals. If Humans (land mammals) can’t drink seawater — just try it! — how can supposed sea mammals like whales stay hydrated?</p>&mdash; Birdwatch Example (@bwatchexample) <a href="https://twitter.com/bwatchexample/status/1353736772459532293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<div class="note note-helpful">

### Helpful Birdwatch note

Whales are indeed mammals. Marine mammals are able to “stay hydrated” because their kidneys have evolved to excrete more salt + reclaim more water than humans and many other mammals can. They also obtain water from their food. This is widely documented, for example in http://reputable…

- Easy to understand
- Directly addresses all of the Tweet’s claims
- Cites high-quality source, which has robust information on the topic

</div>

<div class="note note-unhelpful">

### Unhelpful Birdwatch note

Just another conspiracy theory from another terrible TV host.

- Does not provide additional information about central points made in tweet

2. ### "Nutrition labels are lying"

Here's a Tweet making misleading claims about nutrition labels, followed by helpful and unhelpful Birdwatch notes:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The nutrition labels on my food are lying! Using an at-home science kit, the food I expected to be 100 calories is actually 100,000!!! <br><br>We’re being lied to!</p>&mdash; Birdwatch Example (@bwatchexample) <a href="https://twitter.com/bwatchexample/status/1353416445296668673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<div class="note note-helpful">

### Helpful Birdwatch note

This Tweet is misleading and contains an honest error due to unit conversions. Lowercase c calories are not the same as uppercase C Calories. 1 Calorie = 1000 calories, so 100 Calories = 100k calories. An official table of energy units and conversions can be found here: http://reputable...

- Explains a complex topic using clear language
- Points out where the misleading info likely originated while being respectful to the author
- Provides a link to reliable information

Did you not take high school chemistry????
This is literally the most basic unit conversion ever. I can’t believe you fell for something so simple.
EVERYONE knows that!
