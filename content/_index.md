# Empowering people on Twitter to create a better-informed world.

People come to Twitter to stay informed, and they want credible information to help them do so. This isn’t always easy with the spread of misleading information online.

Birdwatch aims to create a better informed world, by empowering people on Twitter to collaboratively add helpful notes to Tweets that might be misleading.

Birdwatch participants can identify Tweets they believe are misleading, write notes that provide context on the Tweet, and rate the quality of other participants’ notes. Through consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors, our eventual goal is that the most helpful notes will be visible directly on Tweets, available to everyone on Twitter.

Currently, Birdwatch is in pilot mode for people in the US. We're building it in the open, with the public’s input, and we’re taking significant steps to make Birdwatch transparent.

This Guide outlines how Birdwatch works, how one can access and work with Birdwatch's transparent data and is also a place to follow updates to the product. We’ll be sharing how and why we’re making changes, how we came to those decisions, and what we hope to achieve.

We can't wait to learn with you.
