# Writing a Birdwatch note

Anyone in the US can read Birdwatch notes, but only pilot participants can add new notes to Tweets. Here's how to add a note:

1. Click or tap the ••• menu on the Tweet's top right and then **Contribute to Birdwatch**.

2. Before starting, you’ll see a reminder about [**Birdwatch values**](../../values) — a prompt to promote helpful contributions.

3. Answer the required multiple choice questions. These are designed to understand, in a structured way, why a Tweet might or might not be misleading.

4. Finally, in the text field, write the context you feel would help others understand why that Tweet is or is not misleading. Citing sources is helpful. (Each URL counts as only 1 character towards the 280 character limit).

5. After it’s submitted, the note will be available on the Birdwatch site for other participants to read and rate.

6. You can delete your notes at any time by clicking or tapping the ••• icon on a note.

# Rating Birdwatch notes

There are two ways to find Tweets with Birdwatch notes in order to rate their quality:

### Browsing the Birdwatch site

Go to the [**Birdwatch site's Home page**](https://birdwatch.twitter.com) and choose any Tweet to see notes that participants have added to it. There are three main "tabs", or "views" on this page:

- **Needs your help:** Contains Tweets with notes where you can have the most impact when rating. This tab is only visible to pilot participants.
- **New:** Contains Tweets with the most recent notes.
- **Rated Helpful:** Contains Tweets with at least one note rated helpful by the community.

You can learn more about how Birdwatch chooses notes for each of these views on the [**Note Ranking**](../../note-ranking) page of the Guide.

### Browsing Twitter

If you're a Birdwatch pilot participant, you may also see notes on Tweets while browsing Twitter. You can tap to rate those notes:

# Helpfulness status on notes

Birdwatch initially shows most recent notes on top, and displays them with a status indicator that the note **Needs More Ratings**. In some cases — if notes have received enough ratings from other contributors, and certain criteria are met — notes might be moved to the top or bottom of the list and annotated with a header showing that they are **Currently Rated Helpful** or **Currently Not Rated Helpful**.

When notes are **Currently Rated Helpful** or **Currently Not Rated Helpful**, Birdwatch will also show the top two "reasons" selected by raters when rating that note.

# Helpfulness ratings on your notes

You can see how other participants have rated your notes on the **Your Notes** page, which shows an aggregate score of ratings you've received across all notes you’ve written.
