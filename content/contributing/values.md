Birdwatch aims to provide context on Tweets in a way that a broad set of people with diverse perspectives find helpful. We ask that all Birdwatch contributors agree to uphold three core values:

1. ### Contribute to build understanding

Birdwatch seeks to provide helpful context so people can stay better informed about Tweets they see. Itâ€™s not a place for quick dunks, personal opinions, or insults. Write clear, evidence-based notes to help everyone, even skeptics, better understand a Tweet and why it might be misleading.

2. ### Act in good faith

Genuinely and constructively contribute to help others stay informed. Do not attempt to game or manipulate the system.

3. ### Be helpful, even to those who disagree

Birdwatch aims to help all people better understand issues discussed in Tweets, including people who may hold different viewpoints. Contribute in a way that even those who may disagree with you might find helpful and respectful. Avoid hateful, derogatory, or inflammatory language.
