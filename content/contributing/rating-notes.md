There are two ways to find Tweets with Birdwatch notes in order to rate their quality:

## Rating notes on the Birdwatch site

Go to the [**Birdwatch Site's Home page**](https://birdwatch.twitter.com) and choose any Tweet to see notes that participants have added to it. There are three main timelines on this page:

- **Needs your help:** Contains Tweets with notes where you can have the most impact when rating. This tab is only visible to pilot participants.

- **New:** Contains Tweets with the most recent notes.

- **Rated Helpful:** Contains Tweets with at least one note rated helpful by the community.

You can learn more about how Birdwatch chooses notes for each of these views on the [**Note Ranking**](../../note-ranking) page of the Guide.

## Rating notes on Twitter

If you're a Birdwatch pilot participant, you may also see notes on Tweets while browsing Twitter. You can tap to rate those notes:

## Helpfulness status on notes

Birdwatch initially shows most recent notes on top, and displays them with a status indicator that the note **Needs More Ratings**. In some cases — if notes have received enough ratings from other contributors, and certain criteria are met — notes might be moved to the top or bottom of the list and annotated with a header showing that they are **Currently Rated Helpful** or **Currently Not Rated Helpful**.

When notes are **Currently Rated Helpful** or **Currently Not Rated Helpful**, Birdwatch will also show the top two "reasons" selected by raters when rating that note.

## Helpfulness ratings on your notes

You can see how other participants have rated your notes on the **Your Notes** page, which shows an aggregate score of ratings you've received across all notes you’ve written.
