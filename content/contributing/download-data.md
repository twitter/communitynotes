# A guide to working with the Birdwatch data

### Data snapshots

The Birdwatch data is released as two separate files: one containing a table representing all Birdwatch notes and one containing a table representing all Birdwatch note ratings. These tables can be joined together on the `noteId` field to create a combined dataset with information about notes and their ratings. The data is released in two separate tables/files to reduce the dataset size by avoiding data duplication (this is known as a normalized data model). Currently, we release one cumulative file each for notes and note ratings. However, in the future, if the data ever grows too large, we will split the data into multiple files as needed.

A new snapshot of the Birdwatch public data is released daily, on a best-effort basis, and technical difficulties may occur and delay the data release until the next day. We are not able to provide guarantees about when this may happen. The snapshot is a cumulative file and contains all non-deleted notes and note ratings ever contributed to Birdwatch, as of 48 hours before the dataset release time. The data download page displays a date stamp indicating the most recent date of data included in the downloadable files.

### File structure

Each data snapshot table is stored in `tsv` (tab-separated values) file format with a header row. This means that each row is separated by a newline, each column is separated by a tab, and the first row contains the column names instead of data. The note and note rating data is directly taken from the user-submitted note creation and note rating forms, with only minimal added metadata (like ids and timestamp). Below, we will describe each column’s data, including the question or source that generated the data, data type, and other relevant information.
