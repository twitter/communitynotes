Birdwatch's goal is to show helpful context to people when they come across potentially misleading information on Twitter. When a note is rated Helpful by contributors, it starts being shown directly on the Tweet. During this pilot phase, only a limited group of people in the US can see these notes, but our goal is to eventually show them to everyone. Here's how they show up:

## Note views

Birdwatch contributors can see how many times a note has been viewed on Twitter. This number only appears after the first 1000 views, and only reflects the limited test group of people who can currently see Birdwatch notes. Contributors can expect the number of views on their notes to increase significantly as we expand Birdwatch's notes to more people on Twitter.

Views began being counted mid-day May 3, 2022, so notes before then are very unlikely to show any counts, and certainly not accurate counts. Notes written on or after May 4, 2022 should show correct counts.

### Increase the reach and impact of Birdwatch notes

Many Tweets are seen by most people who will see them in a matter of hours. Notes have the greatest visibility, and potential for impact, when:

- They’re written **soon after a Tweet was posted**
- They’re written **on Tweets that have higher visibility**
- They **quickly receive enough ratings from other contributors**. As a contributor, you can help make this happen by rating notes on the "Needs your help" timeline on Birdwatch.

If a Tweet has a Birdwatch note that earned a status of Helpful after being rated by enough contributors then the note content will be shown in the card, along with a button to rate the note. If the Tweet has multiple notes that earned a status of Helpful, the card will show one note, randomly cycling between them at periodic intervals in order to gather additional rating inputs on each.

The one exception to this is if a note with a status of Helpful deems the Tweet **Not misleading**. In this case, since the Tweet was considered not misleading, the note will not be shown on the Tweet.

### Details about which notes are shown

If a Tweet has a Birdwatch note that earned a status of Helpful after being rated by enough contributors then the note will be shown in a card on the Tweet, along with a button to rate the note. If the Tweet has multiple notes with a status of Helpful, the card randomly cycles between the notes at periodic intervals in order to gather additional rating inputs on each.

The one exception to this is if a note with a status of Helpful deems the Tweet “Not misleading.” In this case, since the Tweet was considered not misleading, the note will not be shown on the Tweet.

### Cards only visible to Birdwatch contributors

If a Tweet has notes but none yet have earned a status of Helpful, the card will show the number of notes, and allow people to tap to read and rate those notes on the Birdwatch site.

If all notes on a Tweet have earned a status of Helpful, no card will be shown. Birdwatch contributors will still be able to access these notes via the Birdwatch icon displayed in the Tweet details page.
