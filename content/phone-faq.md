All Birdwatch accounts must have phone numbers that are verified, use a trusted US-based carrier, and are unique among all Birdwatch contributors. This helps protect Birdwatch from spam and uphold the quality of Birdwatch notes.

If you're having trouble with your phone number in Birdwatch, here's what you can do:

## If your phone number is not verified

You can verify your phone number by following [Twitter's Help Center instructions](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-add-a-phone-number-to-your-account).

## If your phone number is associated with more than one Twitter account

If your phone number is associated with multiple Twitter accounts, only the account that most recently verified that number will be able to access Birdwatch.

You can verify your phone number on the account you want to use with Birdwatch by following [Twitter's Help Center instructions](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-add-a-phone-number-to-your-account).

You can optionally remove your phone number from other accounts by going into **Privacy & Settings > Your Account > Account Information > Phone**

## If your phone number is not from a trusted US-based carrier

To reduce the use of artificially created or virtual phone numbers, phone numbers must be from a trusted US-based carrier.
