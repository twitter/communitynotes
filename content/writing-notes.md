Anyone in the US can read Birdwatch notes, but only Birdwatch contributors can add new notes to Tweets. Here's how to add a note:

1. <div> Click or tap the ••• menu on the Tweet's top right and then **Write a Birdwatch note**.
      {{< figure src="../images/1-writing-notes.png">}}
   </div>

2. <div> Before starting, you’ll see a reminder about <a href="../values">Birdwatch values</a>, — a prompt to promote helpful contributions. </div>

3. <div>Answer the required multiple choice questions. These are designed to understand, in a structured way, why a Tweet might or might not be misleading.</div>

4. <div> Finally, in the text field, write the context you feel would help others understand why that Tweet is or is not misleading. Citing sources is helpful. (Each URL counts as only 1 character towards the 280 character limit). </div>

5. <div>After it’s submitted, the note will be available on the Birdwatch site for other contributors to read and rate. </div>

6. <div> If your note gets the status of "Helpful", it will be <a href="../notes-on-twitter/">shown on Twitter as context</a>.</div>

7. You can delete your notes at any time by clicking or tapping the ••• icon on a note.
