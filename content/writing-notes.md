Anyone in the US can read Birdwatch notes, but only Birdwatch contributors can add new notes to Tweets. Here's how to add a note:

1. Click or tap the ••• menu on the Tweet's top right and then **Write a Birdwatch note**.

2. Before starting, you’ll see a reminder about [**Birdwatch values**](../values) — a prompt to promote helpful contributions.

3. Answer the required multiple choice questions. These are designed to understand, in a structured way, why a Tweet might or might not be misleading.

4. Finally, in the text field, write the context you feel would help others understand why that Tweet is or is not misleading. Citing sources is helpful. (Each URL counts as only 1 character towards the 280 character limit).

5. After it’s submitted, the note will be available on the Birdwatch site for other contributors to read and rate.

6. If your note gets the status of "Helpful", it will be [shown on Twitter as context](../notes-on-twitter/).

7. You can delete your notes at any time by clicking or tapping the ••• icon on a note.
