Here you can find links to code that reproduces the note scoring/ranking code that Birdwatch runs in production.

If you download the notes and ratings files made available on the [Birdwatch Data Download](https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch/download-data) page and put them in the same directory as the following files, you can then run `python score_notes.py` to produce a `scoredNotes.tsv` file that contains note scores, statuses, and explanation tags that will match whatâ€™s running in production.
