How does Birdwatch avoid one-sided bias? Pile-ons? Brigading? Manipulation? Abuse?

Community Notes are rated by contributors of multiple perspectives, and only notes that are widely found helpful are shown on Tweets. So one group alone can't determine what notes get shown, and pile-ons aren't effective.

This helps ensure that notes are helpful to a wide range of people.

To make it clear how all of this works, Birdwatch's algorithm is open source, and all the data is public.

See the code on Github: [twitter.github.io/birdwatch](https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch)
