# FAQs

{{< expand "Who is eligible to participate in the Birdwatch pilot? Is there an approval process?" >}}

The first phase of this pilot will be limited to a small test group in the US. [Sign ups are open](https://twitter.com/i/flow/join-birdwatch). Accounts must meet a few criteria to be eligible. [Learn more here](../../join).

{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Are contributions anonymous? Or will my name be attached to my notes?" >}}

All Birdwatch contributions are associated with the Twitter account of the contributor. For example, when someone writes a note, their Twitter handle is not immediately visible by others browsing the [Birdwatch site](http://birdwatch.twitter.com), but can be found via the "Note Details" option on each Note. In concept tests, people consistently told us that they found notes more helpful when they can see who wrote the note (vs it being anonymous). Like the rest of Twitter, accounts can use any display name. People can participate in Birdwatch under any account, including secondary accounts that use a pseudonym.

{{< expand "What Tweets are eligible to be annotated in Birdwatch?" >}}

Any Tweet can receive a Birdwatch note.

{{< expand "Will Birdwatch contributions affect content on Twitter? Will it be used to label or remove Tweets? " >}}

During our initial pilot phase, Birdwatch contributions will not impact the way people outside of the pilot  see Tweets or our recommendation systems. Birdwatch contributions are being intentionally kept separate from Twitter for now while we gain confidence that it produces context people find helpful and appropriate. Eventually, we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors.

{{< expand "Will this eventually replace Twitter’s existing misleading information interventions?" >}}

No. We believe there’s no single blanket tool or intervention that can solve the problem of misleading information on the internet. During this pilot, we aim to learn how Birdwatch may complement our existing efforts.

{{< expand "Why does Birdwatch allow anyone to write notes, rather than just experts?">}}

We believe both experts and non-experts can valuably contribute to identifying and adding helpful context to misleading information. In concept testing, we’ve seen non-experts write concise, helpful and easy-to-understand notes, often citing valuable expert sources.

Many of the internet’s existing collaborative sites thrive with the help of non-expert contributions — Wikipedia, for example. Our approach also draws on recent external research that has shown the potential of a crowdsourced based approach to addressing misleading information on the internet, for example:

- [Pennycook and Rand 2019](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/7/2521)
- [Allen, Arechar, Pennycook, and Rand 2020](https://psyarxiv.com/9qdza)
- [Micallef, He, Kumar, Ahamad, and Memon 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05773)

The people on Twitter span a wide gamut of backgrounds and experiences, and we look forward to everyone being able to contribute to this challenge.

{{< expand "Will researchers and others outside of Twitter be able to download and analyze the data? " >}}

All Birdwatch contributions data are made publicly available on the [Download Data](https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch/download-data) page of the Birdwatch site so that anyone in the US has free access to analyze the data, identify problems, and spot opportunities to make Birdwatch better. [You can learn more about our data here.](../../data)

{{< expand "Is Twitter working with any outside organizations to build this product?" >}}

A wealth of relevant knowledge exists beyond Twitter’s virtual walls, so we are drawing on external research and collaborating with a variety of groups and organizations for their expertise and input. From having a member of the University of Chicago’s Center for RISC embedded on our team, to hosting feedback sessions with reporters and researchers, we’re integrating social science and academic perspectives like behavioral economics, social psychology, political science and procedural justice into our product development process.

{{< expand "There’s a Birdwatch note on one of my Tweets. What does that mean?" >}}

Birdwatch is a pilot program that allows participants to identify information in Tweets they believe may be misleading and write notes that provide additional context. You can learn more about Birdwatch [here](../../).

Currently, notes are only visible to people in the pilot, or on a separate [Birdwatch site](http://birdwatch.twitter.com) for people outside of the pilot and will not impact your account, or change the way your Tweets appear to anyone outside of the pilot. Birdwatch contributions are being intentionally kept separate from Twitter during this pilot phase while we build Birdwatch, and gain confidence that it produces context people find appropriate and helpful.

If you believe a note may have violated the Twitter Rules, you can report it by clicking or tapping the ••• menu on a note, and then selecting "Report”, or by using [this form](https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/birdwatch).

If you’d like to contribute to Birdwatch, learn more about how to sign up for a future spot in our pilot [here](../../join).

{{< expand "Can people be removed from the Birdwatch program? What if someone is writing harmful content in their notes?" >}}

All participants and all Birdwatch contributions are subject to the Twitter Rules. Failure to abide by the rules can result in removal from the Birdwatch pilot, and/or other remediations.

If you believe a note may have violated the Twitter Rules, you can report it by clicking or tapping the ••• menu on a note, and then selecting "Report”, or by using [this form](https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/birdwatch).

{{< expand "How will attempts to abuse or manipulate Birdwatch be prevented?" >}}

Birdwatch will only be successful if the context it produces is found to be helpful and appropriate by a wide range of people with diverse views. This obviously won’t be true if it can be taken over by a single group or ideology, or used in an abusive manner. We’re going to be very focused on achieving that during the pilot. We believe this is possible, and will be experimenting with different mechanics and incentives than Twitter to help make it happen. Learn more about how we are approaching these issues [here](../../challenges).
