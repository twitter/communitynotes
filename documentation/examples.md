description: Learn what makes a helpful Community Note on Twitter.
---

Great notes provide helpful context to Tweets and leave people better informed. But what makes a note helpful?

## Helpful attributes

<div class="noteAttributeList helpful">

- Cites high-quality sources
- Easy to understand
- Directly addresses the Tweetâ€™s claim
- Provides important context
- Neutral or unbiased language

</div>

</br>

## Unhelpful attributes

Helpful notes steer clear of all of these unhelpful attributes:

<div class="noteAttributeList unhelpful">

- Sources not included or unreliable
- Sources do not support note
- Incorrect information
- Opinion or speculation
- Typos or unclear language
- Misses key points or irrelevant
- Argumentative or biased language
- Note not needed on this Tweet
- Harassment or abuse

</div>

</br>
</br>

The following are examples of notes that illustrate what makes a note helpful (versus unhelpful):

## Example 1

            <img class="userAvatar"src="../images/user-avatar.jpeg" alt="User profile avatar"/>
            <div class="tweetNameWrapper">

This photo was taken in Toronto at a protest of the 2010 G20 summit where G20 officials met to discuss the world economy, not at the Supreme Court in Washington D.C. You can see the car in this photo being lit on fire via a local Toronto news broadcast: https://www.youtube.com/watch...

The last time it was reported that a police car was lit on fire outside the Supreme Court was on 7/15/2020. This photo is not from that incident. This photo was taken in Toronto at a protest of the 2010 G20 summit. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/..., https://www.cp24.com/breaking/...

<h3> Unhelpful note </h3>

Wow, people really hate cops. They just park there car to go into the office and itâ€™s suddenly fair game to be torched. Some of you need to relax.

This is totally made up. There are no reports of a fire outside the Supreme Court today. Twitter should ban this account for spreading lies. https://www.supremecourt.gov/

Medkya is the largest crossing point for Ukrainian refugees into Poland but there have been no protests reported. In fact, the Poles have welcomed refugees and called for more resources to support the Ukrainian people. https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/stories...

A reverse image search places this photo at the 2/21/17 Womenâ€™s March in Portland, Oregon. And there are no recorded protests in response to Ukrainian refugees crossing into Medyka, Poland. https://www.npr.org/2022/05/19/...
