description: Contribute to build understanding · Act in good faith · Be helpful, even to those who disagree

Community Notes aims to provide context on Tweets in a way that a broad set of people with diverse perspectives find helpful. We ask that all Community Notes contributors agree to uphold three core values:

1. <div> <strong> Contribute to build understanding</strong>
   <label>
   Community Notes seeks to provide helpful context so people can stay better informed about Tweets they see. It’s not a place for quick dunks, personal opinions, or insults. Write clear, evidence-based notes to help everyone, even skeptics, better understand a Tweet and why it might be misleading.</label></div>

2. <div><strong> Act in good faith </strong>
   <label>
   Genuinely and constructively contribute to help others stay informed. Do not attempt to game or manipulate the system.
   </label>

3. <div> <strong> Be helpful, even to those who disagree </strong>
   <label>
   Community Notes aims to help all people better understand issues discussed in Tweets, including people who may hold different viewpoints. Contribute in a way that even those who may disagree with you might find helpful and respectful. Avoid hateful, derogatory, or inflammatory language.
   </label>
   </div>
