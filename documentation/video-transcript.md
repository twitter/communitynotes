Introducing Community Notes (formerly called Birdwatch).

Sometimes, posts can be misleading or miss important context.

And you aren't sure whether to trust the post…

Community Notes empower people to share helpful context. Here's how it works:

Contributors propose notes that add context to posts. Notes are then rated by other contributors.

Decisions aren't made by majority rules or popularity…So one group alone can't determine what notes get shown. Instead, Community Notes finds notes that are helpful to people with different points of view, and adds them as context to the post.

Rate it. Context is written by people who use X, and appears when rated helpful by others. Find out more”]
