1. <div><strong> Sign up</strong><label>

1. <div><strong> Select an alias so you can keep your identity private</strong><label>
   As a Community Notes contributor, you can now rate the helpfulness of all notes. But first, choose an alias to contribute under (it’s like a pen name!)

   </label>
      </div>

1. <div><strong>Begin rating notes</strong><label>
   Your ratings help determine which notes are made visible on Twitter. To start rating notes, navigate to Community Notes from your Twitter app navigation bar. There, you'll find the notes where your ratings can have the most impact.

     </label>
     </div>

1. <div><strong>Soon, you'll unlock the ability to write your own notes!</strong><label>To unlock the ability to write notes, you need to earn a Rating Impact of 5. You earn Impact when your rating helps a note earn a helpful (or unhelpful) status! You can track your progress on the Rating Impact section of your Community Notes profile.
