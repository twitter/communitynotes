# Notes on Media

Community Notes are frequently added to Tweets that feature images or videos. In many cases, these notes can provide valuable context, not just for a single Tweet, but for any Tweet containing the same media.

Contributors with a Writing Impact score of 10 or above have the option to write notes about the media found within Tweets, as opposed to focusing on the specific Tweet. Contributors should select this option when they believe the context added would be helpful independently of the Tweet the note is attached to.

Tagging notes as “about the image” makes them visible on all Tweets that our system identifies as containing the same image. These notes, when deemed Helpful, accumulate view counts from all the Tweets they appear in, but only count as one Writing and Rating Impact for the author and raters.

To ensure transparency, raters will see a disclaimer indicating that notes about the image may appear across multiple Tweets. This way, they'll be aware that the context provided by these notes extends beyond the specific Tweet they're currently viewing.

When someone rates a media note, the rating is associated with the Tweet on which the note appeared. This allows Community Notes to identify cases where a note may not apply to a specific Tweet.

Currently, this feature is experimental and only supports Tweets with a single image. We're actively working on expanding it to support Tweets with multiple images, GIFs, and videos. Stay tuned for updates.
