# Values

Community Notes aims to provide context on posts in a way that a broad set of people with diverse perspectives find helpful. We ask that all Community Notes contributors agree to uphold three core values:

## 1. Contribute to build understanding

Community Notes seeks to provide helpful context so people can stay better informed about posts they see. It’s not a place for quick dunks, personal opinions, or insults. Write clear, evidence-based notes to help everyone, even skeptics, better understand a post and why it might be misleading.

## 2. Be helpful, even to those who disagree

Genuinely and constructively contribute to help others stay informed. Do not attempt to game or manipulate the system.

## 3. Act in good faith

Community Notes aims to help all people better understand issues discussed in posts, including people who may hold different viewpoints. Contribute in a way that even those who may disagree with you might find helpful and respectful. Avoid hateful, derogatory, or inflammatory language.
