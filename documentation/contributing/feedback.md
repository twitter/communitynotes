Community Notes is early in its development, and our goal is to build it in the open with the public. We invite you on this journey to learn and shape Community Notes alongside us. Feel free to reach out with:

- Questions about the program
- Problems or issues you experience while contributing
- Risks and concerns we might not have considered
- Ideas for product updates or features for our roadmap
- Analyses done with our [public data](../under-the-hood/download-data.md) or feedback about the data.

Talk directly with the team building Community Notes â€” follow, Tweet or DM us [@CommunityNotes](https://twitter.com/communitynotes). We can't wait to hear from you.
