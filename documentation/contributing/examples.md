# Examples and note-writing tips

Great notes provide helpful context to posts and leave people better informed. But what makes a note helpful?

## Helpful attributes

- Cites high-quality sources
- Easy to understand
- Directly addresses the post‚Äôs claim
- Provides important context
- Neutral or unbiased language

## Unhelpful attributes

Helpful notes steer clear of all of these unhelpful attributes:

- Sources not included or unreliable
- Sources do not support note
- Incorrect information
- Opinion or speculation
- Typos or unclear language
- Misses key points or irrelevant
- Argumentative or biased language
- Note not needed on this post
- Harassment or abuse

The following are examples of notes that illustrate what makes a note helpful (versus unhelpful):
