All Community Notes accounts must have phone numbers that are verified, use a trusted carrier, and are unique among all contributors. This helps protect Community Notes from spam and uphold the quality of contributions.

If you're having trouble with your phone number in Community Notes, here's what you can do:

## If your phone number is not verified

You can verify your phone number by following [Twitter's Help Center instructions](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-add-a-phone-number-to-your-account).

## If your phone number is associated with more than one Twitter account

If your phone number is associated with multiple Twitter accounts, only the account that most recently verified that number will be able to access Community Notes.

You can verify your phone number on the account you want to use with Community Notes by following [Twitter's Help Center instructions](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-add-a-phone-number-to-your-account).

You can optionally remove your phone number from other accounts by going into **Privacy & Settings > Your Account > Account Information > Phone**

## If your phone number is not from a trusted carrier

To reduce the use of artificially created or virtual phone numbers, phone numbers must be from a trusted carrier.
