## Welcome to Community Notes's public repository

## About Community Notes

Community Notes aims to create a better informed world, by empowering people on Twitter to add helpful notes to Tweets that might be misleading.

Currently, Community Notes is in pilot mode for people in the US. We're building it in the open, with the public’s input, and we’re taking significant steps to make Community Notes transparent.
