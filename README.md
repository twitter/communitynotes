# Twitter Birdwatch Guide

![](/static/images/hero.png)

## Empowering the Twitter community to create a better-informed world.

Birdwatch allows people to identify information in Tweets they believe are misleading and write notes that provide context. This program aims to build and test a community-based approach that considers a broad and diverse set of perspectives to information found on Twitter.

Currently, Birdwatch is in pilot mode for people in the US. We're building it in the open, with the public’s input, and we’re taking significant steps to make Birdwatch transparent.

This Guide outlines how Birdwatch works, how one can access and work with Birdwatch transparent data and is also a place to follow updates to the product. We’ll be sharing how and why we’re making changes, how we came to those decisions, and what we hope to achieve.

## How to contribute

For this initial phase of the Birdwatch pilot, we’ve turned off public Github contribution tools on GitHub (Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions) while we explore the best ways to engage with the growing community.

For now, this site is intended as a transparent source of information about Birdwatch, including version history of that information. As we develop algorithms that power Birdwatch — such as reputation, consensus, and ranking systems — we also aim to make them publicly available. Our current implementation is already available [here](https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/rating-notes).
