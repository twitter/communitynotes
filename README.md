## Welcome to Community Notes's public repository

This repository holds the Markdown content that is used to generate our [documentation website](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide), the [source code](https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/tree/main/static/sourcecode) powering Community Notes under the hood, our [research paper](https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/blob/main/birdwatch_paper_2022_10_27.pdf), and is a place for us to transparently share updates about the program.

## About Community Notes

Community Notes aims to create a better informed world, by empowering people on Twitter to add helpful notes to Tweets that might be misleading.

We're building it in the open, with the public’s input, and we’re taking significant steps to make Community Notes transparent.

## Sign up and become a Community Notes contributor

Our goal is to expand Community Notes globally. We want anyone to be able to participate and know that having contributors with different points of view is essential to Community Notes helpfully addressing misinformation.

As there are important nuances in each market, we’ll expand the contributor base country-by-country. We’ll add contributors from a first new country soon.
