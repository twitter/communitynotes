      minNumRatersPerNote: Minimum number of ratings which a note must have to be included
        in scoring.  Notes with fewer ratings are removed.
      minRatingsNeeded: Minimum number of ratings for a note to achieve status.
      minMeanNoteScore: Raters included in the second MF round must achieve this minimum
        average intercept for any notes written.
      minCRHVsCRNHRatio: Minimum crhCrnhRatioDifference for raters included in the second
        MF round. crhCrnhRatioDifference is a weighted measure comparing how often an author
        produces CRH / CRNH notes.  See author_helpfulness for more info.

        CRNH threshold and note intercept.  Note that this constant is set negative so that notes with
        larger (magnitude) factors must have proportionally lower intercepts to become CRNH.
      crnhThresholdNMIntercept: Maximum intercept for notes which do not claim a tweet is misleading
        to achieve CRNH status.
      crnhThresholdUCBIntercept: Maximum UCB of the intercept (determined with pseudoraters) for
        notes to achieve CRNH status.
      crhThresholdLCBIntercept: Minimum LCB of the intercept (determined with pseudoraters) for
        notes to achieve CRH status.
      crhSuperThreshold: Minimum intercept for notes which have consistent and common patterns of
        repeated reason tags in not-helpful ratings to achieve CRH status.
